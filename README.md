# klipper-config-e3pro

This is my current klipper config for the Creality Ender 3 Pro

I have the following mods:
SKR Pico V1
Dual Z
BL Touch
Micro Swiss Direct Drive
Tasmota power switch

The macros are not original work.  I've collected them from a variety of sources and have performed some minor modifications 

As with everything in 3D printing:  use at your own risk.

Validate it works with your set up. I'll almost guarantee you'll need to change something.
